# 👋 Hi, I'm **Ramtej Pasela**
### **Power Electronics Engineer | Converter & Controller Designer**

I'm an Electrical & Electronics Engineering graduate and currently a **Project Associate at IIT Bombay**, specializing in **Power Electronics**, and **Hardware Development**.

My main focus is on designing **power converters**, implementing **closed-loop compensators**, and building **digital + hardware systems** for power and energy applications.  

I also work with **IoT/CPS/Digital Twins** as supportive technologies for monitoring and grid fault detection.
